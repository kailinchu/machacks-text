Envision
===========

### Introduction
Envision is a simple and easy to use website that takes in images of notes and converts them into text. 

### Inspiration
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many schools have transitioned to online learning. As such, students are required to submit more online, typed assignments compared to before. However, studies have shown that writing notes out by hand is more effective for learning compared to typing. As students ourselves, we've often wished for an easy way to take pictures of handwritten notes and convert them to text. Envision is the perfect tool for this.
