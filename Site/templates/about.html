    <p>Hey there! Welcome to <span style="color:#829ff7; font-weight: bold">Envision</span>.</p>
    <p>With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many schools have transitioned to <span style="color:#829ff7; font-weight: bold">online learning</span>. Students are required to submit online assignments, but  <span style="color:#829ff7; font-weight: bold"></span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away" target ="_blank"; style="color:#829ff7; font-weight: bold"> studies</a> have shown that  <span style="color:#829ff7; font-weight: bold">writing out </span>your notes is more effective than typing them. As such, we came up with  <span style="color:#829ff7; font-weight: bold">Envision</span>, a website that converts images of  <span style="color:#829ff7; font-weight: bold">notes into text</span>. This website can also be used by students to convert pictures of a teacherâ€™s powerpoints into notes. In the  <span style="color:#829ff7; font-weight: bold">future</span>, we hope to apply Envision towards other areas, as shown in the graphic below.</p>
